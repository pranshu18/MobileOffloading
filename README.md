# Mobile Offloading

In this project, I built a distributed computing infrastructure using smartphones, implementing the concept of mobile offloading through the master-slave model of communication. I used this infrastructure for monitoring battery levels of the slave nodes and also to perform computationally intensive operations such as matrix multiplication more efficiently.

This is an Android application and there are 2 modes that it can be run in- Master Mode, this will discover devices to connect to, and Slave Mode, where the device will make itself available for connection.
